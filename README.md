# Algerian_forest_fires-EDA & FE

Data Set Information:
The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria,namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.

122 instances for each region.

The period from June 2012 to September 2012.
The dataset includes 11 attribues and 1 output attribue (class)
The 244 instances have been classified into a "fireâ„¢ (138 classes) and a "not fire" (106 classes) classes.
### Attribute Information:
  1. Date : (DD/MM/YYYY) Day, month ('june' to 'september'), year (2012)
  2. Weather data observations

  8. Duff Moisture Code (DMC) index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 65.9
  9. Drought Code (DC) index from the FWI system: 7 to 220.4
  10. Initial Spread Index (ISI) index from the FWI system: 0 to 18.5
  11. Buildup Index (BUI) index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 68
  12. Fire Weather Index (FWI) Index: 0 to 31.1
  13. Classes: two classes, namely "Fire" and "not Fire"

**According to the Fuel moisture the fire behavior indices are reacted And by Algerian forest fires dataset in the month of August and September the fire incidents occured more**
